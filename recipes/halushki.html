            <li>
                Snip bacon into small pieces with a scissors and cook in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp,
                stirring often,
                about 10 minutes. Cook and stir onion with bacon until translucent, about 5 more minutes; set bacon and
                onion aside,
                leaving drippings in the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally until
                cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer bacon and onion mixture with drippings into the pot used to cook the noodles and cook and stir
                cabbage until
                coated with drippings. Cover pot and cook until cabbage is tender, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring
                occasionally. Gently stir
                in noodles and season to taste with salt and black pepper.
